<h3>How to use:</h3>
<p>You start by selecting a number on the interface after running the program, if you 
select a number that is not one of the selections the program will spit back an error
at you and stop running. However, if you select the first option you will be prompted
to enter the students ID, the students name, the students age, and the students grade they
are in. If you select the second option you can delete a student by their ID, name, or their
grade. If you select the third option you can search for a student in the database
based on their name or their ID. If you select the fourth option you will display
all students data in the database. From there you can choose to sort the students by name, ID, or chose to return
to the main menu. If you select the fifth option the program will exit.</p>
